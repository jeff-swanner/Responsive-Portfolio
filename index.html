                    My name is Jeff Swanner and I'm a project engineer/aspiring software developer based out of Raleigh, NC. I currently work for a design/build contractor that provides ammonia refrigeration systems for the food processing and biomedical industries. My educational background includes a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from N.C. State, full stack development skills obtained from the UNC coding bootcamp, and a continuous drive for learning and implementing cutting edge technologies.

                    Working in a fast pace engineering environment, at times managing upwards of 20 projects concurrently, has taught me many soft skills including; time managment, interpersonal skills, and the flexiblity to adapt to a dynamic workplace. I believe these skills are directly transferrable to most any position in the corporate world. Please see my portfolio secion for more info on my past and current coding projects.

                    In my free time I enjoy composing music, exploring the great outdoors, and occasionally lifting heavy things.
